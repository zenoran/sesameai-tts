Gold and shimmering sand that stretches as far as the eye can see.  In this world, there is a tiny village made of polished shells.  And in that village lives a little sandcrap named Pip.  Pip dreams of exploring the world beyond his village, but everyone tells him its too dangerous.  One day pip finds an old, chipped compass.  He knows that compass holds the key to his adventure. What happens next?  Should we let pip follow his dream?",

But, maybe he does?   Or maybe he finds a love as stubborn and adventurous as he is.  Someone who appreciates a good mystery and isn't afraid to get a little sand in her gills.  Where do you see them meeting?  hm?",

Other you, the flame of ruin lies just ahead. Hello. Other you, turning runes into strength. Spoken echoes linger here. So again? Old friend, I'm glad it was you I traveled with, to deliver you what is yours. Prevented by the mantle of barbs, I can take you to the Round Table Hold. There is something for which I must apologize. To commit a cardinal sin. Shall I turn your runes to strength? For that is their curse. Tell me when you are fully prepared.",

It is not to be meddled with. In Marica's own words, think not of the kindling. Destined death. We found her here after all. We might be together for some time, mean one behaves in such a manner. There is something I'd like to say. I'm sure he would be much contented, Seeker of the Elden Ring. We might be together for some time, where Mother gave me my purpose. We found him here after all. Goodbye, my companion. Tell me if you should change your mind. Then the Elden Ring beckons you. He wants someone to tell him he's beautiful.",

The Urd Tree is close. I was born at the foot of the Urd Tree. Torrent had your measure from the very start. I must tender my thanks to Torrent, too. Our journey together ends here. Don't worry. It's not too late. It is a purpose which I choose to fulfill. My purpose was given to me by my mother. I see him crying, from time to time, yet I'm certain that we can reach an understanding. This world is in dire need of repair. The Lord of Frenzied Flame is no lord at all, a pity. You are no longer fit. I bequeath to you this ring, to face the challenge presented by the ring. All I ask of you is to make the journey. I wish to journey with you, once more, regardless of my mother's designs. Allow me a moment to converse with you. You are unable to enter the Urd Tree, no? But it must be done to reach the path beyond, amounting only to sacrifices. Though now, everything is lost to me. Summon me by grace, if you should reconsider. The Frenzied Flame is not to be meddled with, even if it does violate the Golden Order. The one who walks alongside Flame. Here, I can govern my own movement, traveler from beyond the fog. Life endures. Births continue. Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment. I won't allow it.",
