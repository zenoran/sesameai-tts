Gold and shimmering sand that stretches as far as the eye can see.  In this world, there is a tiny village made of polished shells.  And in that village lives a little sandcrap named Pip.  Pip dreams of exploring the world beyond his village, but everyone tells him its too dangerous.  One day pip finds an old, chipped compass.  He knows that compass holds the key to his adventure. What happens next?  Should we let pip follow his dream?",

    "wav/crab-story/mono_3.wav": "If pip's bouncing off the shell walls with excitement, he probably wouldnt wait for a map or hidden tunnels.  hehehehe.  Hed probably grap that compass, yell Cya! to the other crabs and scurry out into the sand dunes as fast as his little legs could carry him.  ",
    "wav/crab-story/mono_4.wav": "Love blooms in the strangest places, right?  I bet pip never expected to find the same crab of his dreams, in the middle of a sandstorm.  But, maybe he does?   Or maybe he finds a love as stubborn and adventurous as he is.  Someone who appreciates a good mystery and isn't afraid to get a little sand in her gills.  Where do you see them meeting?  hm?",
